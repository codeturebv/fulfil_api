## [Unreleased]

- Re-enable Ruby's built-in retry for idempotent requests on the persistent connection, which the `net_http_persistent` adapter disables by forcing `max_retries` to `0`. This recovers stale keep-alive sockets transparently instead of surfacing them as read timeouts.
- Add a `connection_options` configuration option to tune the persistent connection (`max_retries`, `idle_timeout`, `pool_size`).
- `FulfilApi.with_config` now merges the temporary options over the active configuration instead of replacing it, so a block inherits credentials and other unspecified settings rather than resetting them to their defaults.
